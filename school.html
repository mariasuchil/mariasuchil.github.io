      <h2>IT Student Intern</h2>
      <p> My internship has given me the best experience a student can ask for. One of the most
        important things I take away is the friendly work environment! Though it 
        may sound silly to most, the welcoming and outgoing environment took my mind away from any 
        outside stressors I was experiencing.

      <h2>IT Student Assistant</h2>
      <p>I was mostly shadowing IT professionals. They solved DNS issues, user account issues, 
        adobe and other software problems, browser and cookies issues and more. I was mostly tasked
        with imaging computers, removing the hard drive, installing and updating devices and software,
        and troubleshooting. I was also tasked with monitoring the Help Desk tickets and resolving 
        simple user issues: syncing google accounts on different browsers, and printer issues.</p>

      <h2>STEM+C Mentor</h2>
      <p> - The two main takeaways from this job are public speaking and explaining hard concepts to 
        non-technical students. Teaching younger students with no prior technical knowledge was truly
        a challenge. I had to practice before my shift and find simple words and everyday examples
        so that they could understand. Explaining coding to them was the most challenging part of all.
        They would get overwhelmed and lose interest so fast that I had to find ways to keep them
        engaged. <br>
        - Majority of these students were hispanic and were just starting to speak English. I had to 
        do my research and translate all the materials to Spanish. I did not find this challenging, I
        just realized how much work it added to my already busy schedule. I did have to learn a lot of
        engineering terms in Spanish which was fun at the beginning.
