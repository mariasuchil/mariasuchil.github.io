  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <br>
  


  <h3> Academics:</h3>
  <p>Hello! My name is Maria Suchil and I am a senior at Texas A&M University. I am majoring in 
    technology management and double minoring in business and cybersecurity.</p>
  <h3>Personal:</h3>
  <p> On my free time, I enjoy playing video games, crocheting, and watching anime. I have a strong interest in traveling; I have 
    been to Japan for a cultural immersion in high school. Ever since then, I have been eager to travel to other countries and I also 
    hope to travel to Antarctica to see some penguins. I tried rock climbing once and developed a fear of heights, despite that I 
    still want to go skydiving and parasailing. </p>
